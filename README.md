# UX 

## Idea:
Idea behind creating this trivia game was to provide an entertainment for one person or a group of people who can compete who's knowledge is better.

It can be played by individuals or a small group. For groups, there is a counter at the bottom right of the screen that tracks the progress through the questionairre and that can be used as a point system.

# Targeted audience:
Everyone over the age of 16, as some questions won't be familiar with the younger audience, especially ones that have older date or ones that under 16 haven't yet heard of.
